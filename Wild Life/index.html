        <p> This complex web of life provides the natural systems we depend on – giving us essentials like water, clean air, fertile soils and a stable climate. <br>
             It gives us food, medicines and materials, and supports millions of jobs. <br>
             It also inspires people around the world – making our lives richer in all sorts of ways. <br>
             But our planet’s wildlife is in crisis – numbers have fallen by more than half since 1970, and species are going extinct at an alarming rate. <br>
             We need to reverse this loss of nature and create a future where wildlife and people thrive again.</p>

                   Exploitation of wild populations has been a characteristic of modern man since our exodus from Africa 130,000 – 70,000 years ago. <br>
                   The rate of extinctions of entire species of plants and animals across the planet has been so high in the last few hundred years, <br>
                   it is widely believed that we are in the sixth great extinction event on this planet; the Holocene Mass Extinction. <br>
                   Destruction of wildlife does not always lead to an extinction of the species in question, however, <br>
                   the dramatic loss of entire species across Earth dominates any review of wildlife destruction as extinction is <br>
                   the level of damage to a wild population from which there is no return.[clarification needed] <br>
                   The four most general reasons that lead to destruction of wildlife include overkill, habitat destruction and fragmentation, <br>
                   impact of introduced species and chains of extinction.
